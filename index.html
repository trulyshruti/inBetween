<p>Find places of interest in-between yourself and a friend with inBetween!</p>

<p>Enter your location and the location of your friend. 
Hit "Let's go!" and you'll find a list of places to go.
You'll get their names, addresses, and how far away they are.
These places are exactly mid-way between you and your friend.</p>

<p>Got a specific venue in mind? Enter the name or type of place, then submit.
Not sure where you are? Hit "Find me!" and you will find out where.
If the mid-way point isn't near any venues, the app will tell you.</p>

<p>Hit "Clear" at any time to clear the form and addresses on-screen.
But you don't have to "Clear" to resubmit - just hit "Let's go!" again.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>HTML5 Geolocation is used to "Find me!" Google Maps API is used to locate addresses. Foursquare API is used to find the venues.</p>

<h3>Who made this app?</h3>

<p>This app was built by Shruti Kulkarni of Columbia University, for HackPrinceton in Fall 2012.</p>
