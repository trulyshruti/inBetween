{"body":"Find places of interest in-between yourself and a friend with inBetween!\r\n\r\nEnter your location and the location of your friend. Hit \"Let's go!\" and you'll find a list of places to go. You'll get their names, addresses, and how far away they are. These places are exactly mid-way between you and your friend.\r\n\r\nGot a specific venue in mind? Enter the name or type of place, then submit. Not sure where you are? Hit \"Find me!\" and you will find out where. If the mid-way point between the two starting points isn't near any venues, the app will let you know, and you can search again.\r\n\r\nHit \"Clear\" at any time to clear the form and addresses on-screen. But you don't have to \"Clear\" to resubmit - just hit \"Let's go!\" again.\r\n\r\nThe app itself is built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. HTML5 Geolocation is used to locate the user. Google Maps API is used to process address searches and locate initial starting points.. Foursquare API is used to find the venues.\r\n\r\nThis app was built by Shruti Kulkarni of Columbia University for HackPrinceton in Fall 2012.\r\n\r\n[back](http://shruti108.github.com/)","google":"","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
