inBetween
=========

Find places of interest in-between yourself and a friend with inBetween!

Enter your location and the location of your friend. 
Hit "Let's go!" and you'll find a list of places to go.
You'll get their names, addresses, and how far away they are.
These places are exactly mid-way between you and your friend.

Got a specific venue in mind? Enter the name or type of place, then submit.
Not sure where you are? Hit "Find me!" and you will find out where.
If the mid-way point isn't near any venues, the app will tell you.

Hit "Clear" at any time to clear the form and addresses on-screen.
But you don't have to "Clear" to resubmit - just hit "Let's go!" again.

### How does it work?

HTML5 Geolocation is used to "Find me!" Google Maps API is used to locate addresses. Foursquare API is used to find the venues.

### Who made this app?

This app was built by Shruti Kulkarni of Columbia University, for HackPrinceton in Fall 2012.
