# inBetween

Find places of interest in-between yourself and a friend with inBetween!

Enter your location and the location of your friend. Hit "Let's go!" and you'll find a list of places to go. You'll get their names, addresses, and how far away they are. These places are exactly mid-way between you and your friend.

Got a specific venue in mind? Enter the name or type of place, then submit. Not sure where you are? Hit "Find me!" and you will find out where. If the mid-way point between the two starting points isn't near any venues, the app will let you know, and you can search again.

Hit "Clear" at any time to clear the form and addresses on-screen. But you don't have to "Clear" to resubmit - just hit "Let's go!" again.

The app itself is built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It uses HTML5 Geolocation as well as the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs.

This app was built at HackPrinceton in Fall 2012.
